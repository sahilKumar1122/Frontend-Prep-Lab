# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up this repository on GitHub.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Frontend interview prep repository"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository named `frontend-interview-prep`
3. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Copy the repository URL

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/sahilKumar1122/frontend-interview-prep.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
